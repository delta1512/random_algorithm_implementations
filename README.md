# random_algorithm_implementations

Random algorithms that I've implemented into code.

Complete:
    
    - Recursive backtracking
    - Factorising a number
    - Binary search algorithm (not entirely finished)
    - Flood fill/"Minesweeper" algorithm
    - Algorithm that generates a colour palette based on the image's contents
    - Circular buffer implementation
    - Ackermann's function
    - "10 print" code (inspiration from https://youtu.be/bEyTZ5ZZxZs)

Planned:
